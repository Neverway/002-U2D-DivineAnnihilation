Chapter 1 - Scene 1
Welcome to Howelfen

Important info: Fox, Miyu, Sam, & Casey are close childhood friends. The setting is a forest with fantasy ruins mixed with old and broken retro 
tech mixed in. The seasons and weather never change, and the sun and moon only set due to a mysterious machine known as the Artificer, which is 
controled by the regions variouse rulers. Fox & Miyu are resourceful adventurers, and enjoy tinkering and repairing old world tech to use on 
their adventures. Sam & Casey have a crush on each other that neither of them are aware of. They work for the royal gaurd, but spend their free 
time adventuring with Fox & Miyu.

Fox is asleep in their bed. A sword is resting on the corner of a book shelf. Next to the shelf is a desk with a red book.

VSFX: ZzZz

There is knocking at the door, that wakes up Fox.

VSFX: Knock! Knock! Knock!

Fox answers the door and steps outside.

Fox: Oh, hey Miyu. What's up?

Outside is Miyu, a cream colored cat with yellow eyes, wearing a green cloak with a dark purple suit.

Miyu: Hey, Fox. We were supposed to meet up at the library about an hour ago. You didn't forget, did you?

Fox: Sorry! I may have overslept a bit. Are Sam and Casey there?

Miyu: Nah, they have some gaurd duties that they have to train for today. So it's just us today.

Fox: Oh, okay. Let me grab my equipment and we'll head to the library.
